Ah, thank you for clarifying â€” yes! You **should include steps 1 to 5** (the ones about setting up the environment) in your `README.md`. Those steps are essential for anyone who clones your project and wants to run it locally.

### âœ… Here's what to include in `README.md`:

Copy and paste the following into your `README.md` (replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub repo path):

````markdown
## ðŸ“¦ Reproduce the Environment

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

#### On Windows (PowerShell):

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run CI locally (optional)

```bash
# Make sure required tools like pytest are installed
pytest
```

> GitHub Actions also runs CI automatically on every push and pull request.
